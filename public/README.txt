Place dress.jpg in one of these locations (the app will use the first it finds):
  • public/dress.jpg
  • public/assets/dress.jpg

The widget uses it as the starting image and as the reference for AI generation (model wearing the dress).
For image-to-image generation to work, the app must be served at a public URL so Nano Banana can fetch the image.
